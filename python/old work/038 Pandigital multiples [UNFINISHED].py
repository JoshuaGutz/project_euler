# 38 Pandigital multiples

def instructions():
    # Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

    # 192 × 1 = 192
    # 192 × 2 = 384
    # 192 × 3 = 576
    # By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 
    # 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 
    # and (1,2,3)

    # The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 
    # 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the 
    # concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

    # What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be 
    # formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , 
    # n) where n > 1?
