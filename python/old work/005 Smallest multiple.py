###The way I did it in Google Drive###
# This does not require programming at all. Compute the prime 
# factorization of each number from 1 to 20, and multiply the greatest 
# power of each prime together:

# 20 = 2^2 * 5
# 19 = 19
# 18 = 2 * 3^2
# 17 = 17
# 16 = 2^4
# 15 = 3 * 5
# 14 = 2 * 7
# 13 = 13
# 11 = 11

# All others are included in the previous numbers.

# ANSWER: 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232 792 560
